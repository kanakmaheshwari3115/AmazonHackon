    question: 'How do I earn EcoCoins?',
    answer: 'You can earn EcoCoins in various ways: daily logins, analyzing products using the "Analyze Product" feature, purchasing products with a high EcoScore (>= 3.7), completing your profile by setting eco-interests, achieving analysis streaks, completing sustainability quizzes, successfully listing or purchasing items on the marketplace, and returning packaging through our Return Packaging System.',
    category: 'EcoCoins',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq2',
    question: 'What is the difference in EcoCoin earning for regular products vs. marketplace items?',
    answer: `For regular products from our catalog, you earn ${COINS_SUSTAINABLE_PURCHASE_HIGH_ECOSCORE} EcoCoins if the product's EcoScore is ${HIGH_ECOSCORE_THRESHOLD} or higher. For marketplace items, the buyer earns ${COINS_FOR_MARKETPLACE_PURCHASE_USED_ITEM} EcoCoins for purchasing any available used item, promoting reuse. Listing an item on the marketplace also earns you ${COINS_FOR_LISTING_ITEM} EcoCoins.`,
    category: 'EcoCoins',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq3',
    question: 'How is the EcoScore calculated?',
    answer: 'The EcoScore is a comprehensive rating from 1 to 5 (5 being best). It considers the product\'s carbon footprint (lower is better), durability, eco-friendliness of its packaging, health impact (low chemical use), and the sustainability of its materials (e.g., organic, recycled).',
    category: 'Products & Sustainability',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq4',
    question: 'How does the Circular Economy Marketplace work?',
    answer: 'Our marketplace allows users to list, sell, buy, or trade used items. This extends product lifecycles and promotes a circular economy. Listing an item or purchasing a used item rewards you with EcoCoins. You can set prices in EcoCoins, simulated USD, or offer items for trade.',
    category: 'Marketplace',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq5',
    question: 'What\'s the difference between "Analyze by URL" and "Analyze by Image"?',
    answer: '"Analyze by Image" sends the uploaded image to our AI for visual analysis to identify the product and estimate its sustainability. "Analyze by URL" is currently a simulation; the AI imagines a common product that might be sold at such a URL and provides a fictional analysis, as direct web page scraping is not performed client-side.',
    category: 'Product Analysis',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq_eco_assistant',
    question: 'What can I ask the Eco Assistant chatbot?',
    answer: `The Eco Assistant is here to help you with two main things:
1.  **App Navigation & Features:** Ask it questions like 'Where can I find my EcoCoins wallet?', 'How do I list an item on the marketplace?', or 'What is an EcoScore?'. It has information about the EcoShop Navigator's sections and functionalities.
2.  **Sustainability Advice:** You can also ask general eco-specific questions, such as 'How can I reduce my plastic use?' or 'What are some tips for sustainable fashion?'. It will provide helpful information and tips.

The assistant also considers your recent product analysis history for more relevant general advice.`,
    category: 'App Features',
  },

    id: 'faq6',
    question: 'What is a Group Buy?',
    answer: 'The Group Buy feature (simulated) allows multiple users to collectively purchase items. This can lead to benefits like reduced shipping emissions (simulated as CO2 savings) and potential discounts. Add items to your Group Buy cart to see the simulated impact!',
    category: 'Shopping Features',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq7',
    question: 'How does the "Sustainable Packaging" option in the Dashboard work?',
    answer: `Opting for "Sustainable Packaging" in your dashboard applies a small simulated CO2 saving (${ECO_PACKAGING_CO2_SAVING} kg CO2e) to your orders, reflecting the reduced impact of eco-friendly packaging materials.`,
    category: 'Shopping Features',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq8',
    question: 'What is the "My Impact Dashboard" for?',
    answer: 'The "My Impact Dashboard" (currently a mock-up) will provide a personalized overview of your sustainable actions, including total CO2 saved, products analyzed, EcoCoins earned, sustainability streaks, and comparisons against community averages. It aims to visualize your positive environmental contributions.',
    category: 'User Engagement',
  },
   {
    id: 'faq9',
    question: 'How do I become a seller?',
    answer: 'Click on the "Become a Seller" link in the footer to go through our (simulated) seller registration wizard. Completing steps will also earn you EcoCoins!',
    category: 'Seller Features',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq10',
    question: 'What are Eco-Interests in my Dashboard?',
    answer: 'Setting your Eco-Interests (e.g., "Organic Materials", "Recycled Content") helps personalize your experience. Currently, these preferences can influence AI-powered product search suggestions to better match what you care about.',
    category: 'User Profile',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq11',
    question: 'How does the AI-powered search work?',
    answer: 'When you search for products and if the Gemini AI is available, it can generate new product ideas based on your keywords and selected Eco-Interests. If AI is not available, the search will filter through our existing product catalog.',
    category: 'App Features',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq12',
    question: 'How does the Return Packaging System work?',
    answer: 'For eligible orders, you can return the product packaging after use. Go to "My Returns" (link in the header), select the package, report its condition, and use the provided (simulated) QR code at a drop-off point. This helps reduce waste and promotes a circular economy.',
    category: 'Returns & Packaging',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq13',
    question: 'How do I earn EcoCoins for returning packaging?',
    answer: `You earn a base of ${COINS_PACKAGE_RETURN_BASE} EcoCoins for successfully returning packaging. If the packaging is in "Good" condition, you'll receive an additional ${COINS_PACKAGE_GOOD_CONDITION_BONUS} EcoCoins bonus. If it's "Slightly Damaged", there's a ${PENALTY_PACKAGE_SLIGHT_DAMAGE} EcoCoin penalty from the base. "Heavily Damaged" packaging may result in a larger penalty and no base reward.`,
    category: 'Returns & Packaging',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq14',
    question: 'What are the different package conditions I can report?',
    answer: 'You can report the packaging as "Good" (like new, fully reusable), "Slightly Damaged" (minor wear, still functional), or "Heavily Damaged" (significant damage, may not be reusable). Please be honest as this impacts the return process and your potential EcoCoin reward.',
