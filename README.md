*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (configured in `index.html`), custom CSS for scrollbars and animations.
*   **Data Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` is used to simulate user sessions, preferences, cart contents, EcoCoins, and history.
*   **Module System:** ES6 Modules with an `importmap` defined in `index.html`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Gemini API Integration

The application leverages the Google Gemini API for several AI-powered features.

### API Key Setup
The Google Gemini API key **must** be provided as an environment variable named `API_KEY`.
```
API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```
This application assumes `process.env.API_KEY` is accessible in the execution context where `geminiService.ts` initializes the API client. **The application will not prompt for an API key, nor does it provide UI for managing it.** Ensure this environment variable is correctly configured in your deployment or development setup.

If the API key is not set or is invalid, AI-related features will be disabled or provide fallback responses, and a warning will be logged to the console.

### Models Used
*   **General Text Tasks:** `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` (for product idea generation, descriptions, eco-tips, chatbot responses, voice command interpretation, seller suggestions, marketplace chat simulation).
*   **Image Analysis Tasks:** `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` (for analyzing uploaded product images for sustainability insights and barcode simulation).
*   *(Note: `imagen-3.0-generate-002` is specified in coding guidelines for image generation, but this app currently focuses on image analysis/understanding rather than generation.)*

### Core AI Service (`services/geminiService.ts`)
This module encapsulates all interactions with the Gemini API:
*   `getEcoTip()`: Fetches a concise sustainability tip.
*   `generateProductDescription()`: Creates eco-focused product descriptions.
*   `generateProductIdeas()`: Suggests new product ideas based on keywords and user interests.
*   `analyzeProductUrl()`: Provides a *simulated* sustainability analysis for a product based on a given URL.
*   `analyzeProductImage()`: Analyzes an uploaded image to identify a product and estimate its sustainability metrics.
*   `analyzeProductImageForBarcodeSimulation()`: Analyzes an image, identifies a product, estimates metrics, and generates a *simulated* barcode.
*   `interpretVoiceCommand()`: Interprets a user's (typed) voice command to determine intent and parameters.
*   `getChatbotResponse()`: Powers the "Eco Assistant" by providing contextual responses based on user input, app knowledge, and analysis history.
*   `getSellerSuggestions()`: Provides AI-generated descriptions and keywords for sellers listing products.
*   `getSimulatedSellerResponse()`: Generates responses for the AI seller in the marketplace chat.
*   `isGeminiAvailable()`: Checks if the API key is configured.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project uses a simple setup with `index.html` directly importing ES modules.

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser that supports ES Modules and `importmap`.
*   (Optional, for development/modification) Node.js and npm/yarn if you plan to introduce build tools or manage packages traditionally.

### Setup & Running
1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Set up the API Key:**
    As mentioned, the `API_KEY` for Google Gemini must be available as `process.env.API_KEY`. Since this is a client-side application without a visible build step in the provided files, you'll need to ensure your environment or a manual pre-processing step makes this key available to `geminiService.ts`.
    *   **One simple way for local testing (not for production):** You could temporarily replace `process.env.API_KEY` in `geminiService.ts` with your actual key string for testing. **Remember to remove it before committing.**
    *   **Recommended for development:** Use a tool like Vite or Parcel which can handle `.env` files and inject environment variables during development.
3.  **Open the Application:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    *Example using a live server (if you have one installed, e.g., via VS Code extension or `npm install -g live-server`):*
    ```bash
    live-server .
    ```
    Or, directly open `index.html` using the `file:///` protocol, though some browser features might be restricted.

## üåç Functionality Overview (User Perspective)

1.  **Explore Products:** Users land on the home page with featured products and a multi-modal search hub. They can search via text (with suggestions), simulated voice commands, or by "scanning" a product image (uploading an image for AI analysis).
2.  **View Product Details:** Clicking on a product opens a modal with detailed information, including its EcoScore, carbon footprint, materials, and an AI-generated description.
3.  **Analyze External Products:** Users can navigate to the "Analyze Product" section to get AI-driven sustainability insights for products not listed on the site by providing a URL or uploading an image.
4.  **Shop Sustainably:**
    *   Add products to either an "Individual Cart" or a "Group Buy Cart."
    *   Group buys simulate CO‚ÇÇ savings.
    *   Opt for "Sustainable Packaging" in the User Dashboard for further CO‚ÇÇ reduction.
5.  **Engage with the Marketplace:**
    *   Browse items listed by other users (simulated).
    *   List their own used items for sale or trade.
    *   "Purchase" items, earning EcoCoins and contributing to CO‚ÇÇ savings.
    *   Chat with an AI simulating the seller for listed items.
6.  **Manage Returns:**
    *   View eligible packaging for return in "My Returns."
    *   Initiate a return, report package condition, and use a simulated QR code.
    *   Earn EcoCoins for successful returns.
7.  **Earn & Spend EcoCoins:**
    *   Accumulate EcoCoins through various activities (see Core Features).
    *   Visit the "EcoCoins Wallet" to check balance, view transaction history, take quizzes, and redeem rewards.
8.  **Track Impact:** The (mocked-up) "My Impact Dashboard" shows personalized sustainability statistics and comparisons.
9.  **Use the Eco Assistant:** A floating chatbot provides help with app navigation and offers general sustainability advice.
10. **Customize Experience:** Toggle light/dark themes, set eco-preferences in the User Dashboard.
11. **Become a Seller (Simulated):** Go through a registration wizard to become a seller and manage product listings in a dedicated Seller Admin area.

## üåø EcoScore Calculation

The `EcoScore` for each product is a rating from 1 to 5 (higher is better) and is dynamically calculated in `utils/ecoScoreCalculator.ts`. It considers:
*   **Carbon Footprint:** Normalized score where lower CO‚ÇÇ footprint yields a higher score.
*   **Materials:** Points awarded for use of sustainable keywords (e.g., "organic," "recycled").
*   **Durability Score:** Based on product data (1-5).
*   **Packaging Score:** Based on product data (1-5, for eco-friendliness).
*   **Health Impact Score:** Based on product data (1-5, for low chemical use, non-toxicity).

These factors are weighted/averaged to produce the final EcoScore.

## üí° Future Enhancements (Potential)

The extensive type definitions and constants suggest potential for:
*   More detailed user profiles and social interactions.
*   Advanced analytics and goal tracking in the Personal Impact Dashboard.
*   Integration with actual e-commerce backends.
*   Real-time collaborative group buys.
*   More sophisticated AI-driven personalization and recommendations.
*   Expansion of the rewards and achievements system.
